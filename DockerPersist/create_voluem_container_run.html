  <h1>Few Commands</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      docker volume ls
    </li>
    <li>
      docker volume inspect <volumeName>

  <h1>Creating Volume</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2><b>Use Command Below to create Named Volume</b>:</h2>
      <p>
        docker container run --detach --name mysql_db --env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql 
      </p>
      <p>The name volume can be used for another mysql server too</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Working with PostGres need to provide the password!</p>
      <p>Can Use : POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypasswd, or POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust</p>
      <p>Command to create a volume</p>
      <p>docker container run -d --name mypostgres_conn --env POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -v postgres_vol:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.1</p>
      <p>In case we update the above Postgres Version then we can just do following command</p>
      <p>docker container run -d --name mypostgres_conn2 --env POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -v postgres_vol:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.2</p>
      <p>Using this, if we do `docker container logs mypostgres_conn`, for the first container, output will be like</p>
      <p>
        ********************************************************************************
WARNING: POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD has been set to "trust". This will allow
         anyone with access to the Postgres port to access your database without
         a password, even if POSTGRES_PASSWORD is set. See PostgreSQL
         documentation about "trust":
         https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-trust.html
         In Docker's default configuration, this is effectively any other
         container on the same system.

         It is not recommended to use POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust. Replace
         it with "-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password" instead to set a password in
         "docker run".
********************************************************************************
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -l logfile start
initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
initdb: hint: You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.
