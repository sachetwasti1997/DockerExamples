Image is:
- App binaries and dependencies for application
- Metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- An Image is an ordered collection of root fileSystem changes and 
  the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime
- Inside the Image there is no complete OS. There is no Kernal, drivers ie Kernal Modules
  It is only just the binaries that our application may need, and the host in which it
  runs provides the kernal.
